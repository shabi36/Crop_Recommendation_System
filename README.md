# 🌱 **Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security, and selecting the right crop for a given piece of land is vital for maximizing yield. This project leverages **machine learning** 🤖 to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on **soil and climatic conditions**. By analyzing key agricultural factors, this system provides data-driven insights to help farmers make informed decisions.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The main goal of this project is to develop a **multi-class classification model** that suggests the **best crop** 🌾 based on environmental and soil parameters.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of several important agricultural features:  
🌡️ **Temperature** – Ideal growing conditions for different crops.  
💧 **Humidity** – Moisture levels required for healthy growth.  
🌦️ **Rainfall** – Annual precipitation affecting crop selection.  
🌱 **Soil Conditions** – Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels.  

Data preprocessing ensures missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and numerical features are normalized.  

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**  
We explore multiple ML models to determine the best crop recommendation strategy:  
⚡ **Random Forest Classifier**  
📈 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
🎯 **Decision Tree Classifier**  
🔥 **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  

Performance is evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, ensuring the best model provides **reliable recommendations**.
